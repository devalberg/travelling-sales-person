## About project
This project is written in JavaScript (ES6) and uses html and canvas as visualizers.

Webpack and Babel is used to compile ES6 to ES5.

Testing is done using Jest.

## Running locally

Download and run `$ npm install` to install all dependencies. You can run `$ npm run dev` to start a development server which will open a new tab in your browser with the visualizer. Another option would be to run `npm run build` which will create a `dist` folder and from there you can simply open `index.html` from within the dist folder.
